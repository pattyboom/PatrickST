git pull
git fetch updates remote tracking branches. git merge updates the current branch with the corresponding remote tracking branch. 
Using git pull, you get both parts of these updates. 
But, this means that if you are checked out to feature branch and you execute git pull, when you checkout to master, any new updates will not be included. 
Whenever you checkout to another branch that may have new changes, itâ€™s always a good idea to execute git pull.
